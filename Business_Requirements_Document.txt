# Business Requirements Document - Admission Application Modernization

**1. Introduction**

*   **Purpose of the Document**: This document outlines the business requirements for the modernization of the existing admission application system (FE2025). It consolidates findings from architectural analysis, code review, and inferred business processes to provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's current functionality and future needs from a business perspective.
*   **Scope of the Application**: The application is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to manage the end-to-end admission and counseling process for an educational institution. It covers candidate registration, application submission, document verification, multi-round counseling (CAP Rounds), fee management, communication, reporting, and various administrative functions.
*   **Target Audience**: This document is intended for stakeholders involved in the modernization project, including business analysts, product owners, development teams (frontend, backend, QA), project managers, and system administrators.

**2. High-Level Overview**

The FE2025 application serves as a critical portal for managing student admissions. It facilitates a structured, multi-stage process, ensuring compliance with various academic and administrative regulations. The system interacts with multiple external services to streamline operations and enhance user experience.

*   **Key User Roles and their Interactions**:
    *   **Candidate**: The primary user, responsible for registration, application submission, document uploads, participation in counseling rounds, fee payments, and communication with support.
    *   **Admin**: Oversees the entire system, manages configurations, master data, user accounts (for other roles), monitors application progress, generates reports, and handles global communications.
    *   **AFC (Application Facilitation Center) Officer**: Assists candidates with application processes, performs initial document verification, and confirms applications.
    *   **ARC (Admission Reporting Center) Officer**: Manages post-allotment processes, including seat acceptance confirmations and handling admission cancellations.
    *   **Institute Officer**: Manages institute-specific data, course information, confirms admissions, and handles institute-level reporting.
    *   **RO (Regional Officer)**: Provides regional oversight, potentially aggregating data and reports from multiple AFCs/ARCs/Institutes within their jurisdiction.
    *   **MVSO (Merit List Verification Scrutiny Officer)**: A specialized role involved in the verification of merit list data, potentially reviewing discrepancies and recommending candidates.

The application workflow typically starts with Candidate registration, progresses through various stages of application form filling and document submission, proceeds to counseling rounds, and culminates in admission confirmation at an institute. Each stage involves specific interactions between Candidates and administrative roles (AFC, ARC, Institute), all managed and monitored by the Admin.
